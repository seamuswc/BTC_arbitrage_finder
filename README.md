# BTC_arbitrage_finder

`ruby index.rb`

currently finds largest arbitrage opportunity between:
 `Binance`
 `Huobi`
 `Bitfinex`
 `Digifinex`

 `Digifinex.rb` needs a public apikey to be added inorder to work.

 Searches the common `BTC / Crypto` pairings

 To reduce the exchange scope edit the `@exchanges` array in the `main.rb` `initialize` method

 Will take a few to minutes to complete
